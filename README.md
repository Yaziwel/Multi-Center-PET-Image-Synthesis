# Multi-Center PET Image Synthesis

Multi-center positron emission tomography (PET) image synthesis aims at recovering low-dose PET images from multiple different centers. If this project helps your research or work, please help to ‚≠ê this repo or recommend it to your friends. Thanksüòä



**Code and data will be available in October after MICCAI 2023 conference!**



Among the data we used, there are two centers whose data were obtained from the [Ultra-low Dose PET Imaging Challenge](https://ultra-low-dose-pet.grand-challenge.org/) . We do not have the authority to publicly release the data from these two centers. Interested researchers can download the data from these two centers on the challenge's official website.
